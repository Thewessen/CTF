Question:
In a filesystem, everything is relative ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Can you find a way to get a
flag from this program [1] ? You can find it in
/problems/absolutely-relative_4_bef88c36784b44d2585bb4d2dbe074bd on the shell
server. Source [2] .

Hints:
(1) Do you have to run the program in the same directory? (⊙.☉)7
(2) Ever used a text editor? Check out the program 'nano'

Answer:
picoCTF{3v3r1ng_1$_r3l3t1v3_3b69633f}
