        This looks like another MySQL injection. You get a webpage with a
        username and password input. If you type in a username, the site
        responds with, "new user created". When you type in the same username
        (and the same password), the page responds with "Welcome ... Here is
        you data: username =&gt; ... and password =&gt; ...". When you type
        in the username natas28, the page responds with "Wrong password". There
        is also a 'view-source' link. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The source looks more complicated. There is a comment stating the
        database is cleared every 5 minutes. Should be enough...
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important function in the source is as follows:
        <ol>
          <li><code>if $_REQUEST["username"] and
                     $_RQUEST["password"]</code><br>
              connect to database
            <ol>
              <li>if validUser( username )
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    if <code>checkCredentials( username , password )</code><br>
                    Welcome ... <code>dumpDate( username )</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>     
                    else<br>
                    Wrong password for <code>htmlentities( username )</code>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>else<br>
                <code>createUser( username, password )</code>
                User was created
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>else<br>
            <code>html-form</code>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        Maybe overflowing the database user input is a thing?? MySQL trunks a
        username when it's more than 65535 characters long. It get's created,
        but the lookup username will fail because the username is trunked??
        Have a look at 
        <a href='https://kitctf.de/writeups/gits2015/aart' rel="noreferrer">
        this</a>. Trying out the respons, which is not realy the response of
        the database, I can get a max of 16364 characters as usernames. Otherway
        the site won't even accept my get request... But! The site always
        responds with 'user created'... Can't log in with the same username. So
        maybe trunk is a thing here?<br>
        <b>edit:</b> Have proof that a password get's trunked too 64 chars.
        This means, if a password is <code>"A"*64+"B"</code> the password
        becomes <code>"A"*64</code>. It is the same for the username, tested!

        for MySQL injections using different which utilizes different
        char encodings called 'multibyte' injections. Thoug, when trying, it
        didn't work the same for me. Probably because of the single-quotes
        surrounding the query.

        Oke, after making a drawing and re-reading all the links I posted, I
        migth be on too something here. Defenitly the <code>%bf'</code> trick
        does something, although not what I would expect. For example, if
        <code>username=natas27</code> and <code>password=%bf'</code>. A new
        user 'natas27' is created. But the password is not empty! Trying the
        same password again gives a log in, but no array with data?!? That's so
        strange to me. Also the multibyte injection only seems to work an
        params send, not on data send, both POST and GET methods. And you need
        to make a params string in Python first, otherwise the
        <code>'%'</code>-sign gets escaped as <code>%25</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's review the input <span class='user-input'>
          username=natas27&amp;password=%bf'</span>. Lets asume <code>'%bf'' -&gt;
          '%bf%27' -&gt; '%bf%5c%27 -&gt; '?'</code>, where '?' is a special
        character:
        <ul>
          <li>valid?</li>
          <li>
            <code>
              SELECT * from users where username=<span class='user-input'>'natas27'</span>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>create user</li>
          <li>
            <code>
              INSERT INTO users (username, password) values 
              ('<span class='user-input'>natas27</span>','<span class='user-input'>?'</span>')
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>credentials?</li>
          <li>
            <code>
              SELECT username froom users where 
              username='<span class='user-input'>natas27</span>' and password='<span class='user-input'>?'</span>'
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>dump data</li>
          <li>
            <code>SELECT * from users where 
              username='<span class='user-input'>natas27</span>'
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Oke, we can't get anywhere. Yes 'we', because Bart was here to help me
        out. I would have really thoughed we could solve this level together.
        We spend hours brainfarting about the <code>%bf</code> special &iquote; character.
        At the end of the day, we figured out it was not the database that
        returned no data... It was that an empty user gets inserted. HTML
        doesn't recognize the <code>%bf</code> character (only the 
        <code>%2c%bf</code> character). That way the REQUEST crashes, and an
        <i>empty</i> user is inserted. We didn't had more time to think about
        an other solution. Lucky for us Google did know one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution reallies lies in the trunking 64chars input of the
        database. And the fact that, when a user is inserted in the database,
        the input string get trimmed. This way we can created another user
        <i>natas28</i> with our own password. On the creadentials check, our
        query is check. But because the <code>fetch_asoc()</code> is called
        only on the username, the first entry with username natas28 is
        returned (which is ofcourse the 'real' natas28 user).
      </p>
      <p>
        Step by step:
        <ol>
          <li>Post new user with <code>username=natas28 + " "*64 + '1'</code>
            and <code>password=1</code></li>
          <li>Another request with <code>username=natas28</code> and
            <code>password=1</code></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Next level password:</li>
        <li><code>JWwR438wkgTsNKBbcJoowyysdM82YjeF</code></li>
      </ul>
