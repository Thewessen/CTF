        Oke, so you need to login as admin... mmm. Basic MySQL-injection don't
        work here. Looking at the source, there is actually no query. It is a
        simple php-SESSION.
      </p>
      <p>
        It get's more stranger. The function to set the
        <code>$_SESSION["admin"]</code> too 1 is commented out for being to
        'unsafe'. Damn! Otherwise, only the username had to be 'admin' to be
        logged in as admin. But this time we need to set the
        <code>["admin"]</code> ourselfs? How should we do that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Oke, after messing around a bit I stumbled on a part of the solution.
        The <code>PHPSESSID</code>. This bit of code is added in the request
        cookie. And would probably tell the browser our current session id.
        Maybe if we had an other id, we would be able to log in as admin?
      </p>
      <p>
        After googling how to set a header cookie in a Python-script (yes, I'm
        beginning to LOVE Python), I wrote a short python-script to try out all
        the different <code>PHPSESSID</code> between 1 and 640. The source code
        actually tells us the max is 640 id's. The script is called natas18.py.
