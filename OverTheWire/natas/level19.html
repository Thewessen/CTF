        <li><b>Username:</b> natas19</li>

        So this is basically the same as natas18. There is no
        'view-source'-link. The site states that the source code is almost the
        same as natas18, accept that the PHPSESSID is not in order. Viewing the
        PHPSESSID in the browser, this cookie is also very long!
      </p>
      <p>
        I started by grabbing some different session-cookies and analysing
        them. Logging into the browser didn't work for me, because the cookie
        is stored, and you need to keep reseting. An automated Python
        script is much nicer anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cookie consist of 21 chars, ranging from 0 to f (probably hex).
        Bruteforcing them is simply to large. But there should be a pattern!
        Let's analyse some session cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at the lines commented out in the natas19.py script. It basically
        forges a request and print the cookie. I had the script run like
        1000 (x2) times and piped all the output into a file. I used vim to
        clean up the file, sort it, and removed duplicates (yes there were).
        And noticed a pattern in the cookie: <code>3 range(1,63430)
        2d6e617461733139</code>. The first digit and the last part of the
        string are the same for every session. Still much possebilities, but lets
        try and bruteforce this, using almost the same Python script as
        natas18.py.
      </p>
      <p>
        No luck! The script ran for almost half on hour, but no admin-login
        popup... damn! Maybe the last part of the cookie is actually telling
        I'm not admin. And yes, when changing the data='username' key to admin,
        the last chars of the cookie change: <code>2d61646d696e</code>. But
        still no luck bruteforcing the cookie with this new tail. NO WAY!! The
        script just needed like 30 minutes more :D. The PHPSESSID that did the
        trick: <code>3238312d61646d696e</code>! So cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some extra notes about the cookie (while waiting for the script):
        Only the username key changes the tail of the cookie. The first digit
        is (until now) unchanged. Actually, the head of the cookie always
        contains 2, or 4, or 6 digits, in pairs of <code>3# 3# 3#</code>, where
        <code>#=range(0,9)</code>. This should have bin much faster too
        bruteforce xD. Let's addapt the script a bit and try again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The script is optimized and super fast.. But I already had the flag!
        <b>edit</b>: After looking at some solutions, i found an even nicer
        Python script that uses the <code>.encode('hex')</code> method. With
        this method it is easier too loop over a range of interger (you don't
        have to add the 3's statically). Should have thouged of it myself! In
        the third paragraph i stated: 'probably hex' xD Addepted the script and
        it's even faster now.
