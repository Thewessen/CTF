# A setuid binary that connects to port and compares current password with
# line read. If match, returns the flag.

use:
2 logins...
(1) nc -l localhost -p 31337 -c "cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20"
(2) ./suconnect 31337

You create a listening port on localhost which sends the passwd after a
connection.

But nc closes the connection after the command has bin send.. damn!


use:
cat < /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 - | nc -l localhost -p 31337
(cat - means keep reading from stdin)

flag:
gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
