My script didn't work as planned, so I used a tool on the internet:
https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher

One of the problems with my script is that it's a DEcipher, so you need to rotate BACK xD (fixed)
Another problem is that the tool on the internet gave different possible keylengths?!? And the first one (9) was the correct one.
I would have never found the password this way....
